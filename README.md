## Getting Started

To use these GitHub Actions, add them to your workflow with the appropriate inputs. You must have a secondary repository (e.g. `ci-lock-state`) that stores the lock files.

---

## Token Permissions

You must pass a GitHub token with the following scopes:
- `repo` ‚Äì to push lock files to the lock state repository
- `workflow` ‚Äì (optional) if using this in workflow dispatch or reusable workflows

---

## Usage

### Acquire Lock

This step acquires a lock by writing a `.locks/<lock_name>.lock` file to the specified repo. It stores metadata like who acquired the lock and when.

```yaml
- name: Acquire Lock
  uses: billypearson/github-action-ci-lock/acquire-lock@v1
  with:
    lock_name: agent-release                # Unique identifier for this lock
    lock_repo: billypearson/ci-lock-state   # Repo that stores the lock file
    github_token: ${{ secrets.PAT }}        # GitHub token with write access to lock_repo
    locked_by: releasebot                   # Tag the lock holder (bot, user, etc.)
    sha: ${{ github.sha }}                  # (optional) Commit SHA
    source: "workflow:agent-release"        # (optional) Contextual source description
    retry_count: 5                          # (optional) Retry up to 5 times
    retry_delay: 10                         # (optional) Wait 10s between retries
```

### Release Lock

This step removes the lock file from the lock state repository. It should run in `finally`/`if: always()` to ensure cleanup.

```yaml
- name: Release Lock
  if: always()
  uses: billypearson/github-action-ci-lock/release-lock@v1
  with:
    lock_name: agent-release                # Match the lock name used earlier
    lock_repo: billypearson/ci-lock-state   # Same repo used for storing locks
    github_token: ${{ secrets.PAT }}        # GitHub token with write access
```
